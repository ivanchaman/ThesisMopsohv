  abstract = {{<p>Traditional methods for creating intelligent computational systems
	have<br>privileged private "internal" cognitive and computational
	processes. In<br>contrast, <i>Swarm Intelligence</i> argues that
	human<br>intelligence derives from the interactions of individuals
	in a social world<br>and further, that this model of intelligence
	can be effectively applied to<br>artificially intelligent systems.
	The authors first present the foundations of<br>this new approach
	through an extensive review of the critical literature in<br>social
	psychology, cognitive science, and evolutionary computation. They<br>then
	show in detail how these theories and models apply to a new<br>computational
	intelligence methodologyparticle swarmswhich focuses<br>on adaptation
	as the key behavior of intelligent systems. Drilling down<br>still
	further, the authors describe the practical benefits of applying
	particle<br>swarm optimization to a range of engineering problems.
	Developed by<br>the authors, this algorithm is an extension of cellular
	automata and<br>provides a powerful optimization, learning, and problem
	solving method. <br><p><br>This important book presents valuable
	new insights by exploring the<br>boundaries shared by cognitive science,
	social psychology, artificial life,<br>artificial intelligence, and
	evolutionary computation and by applying these<br>insights to the
	solving of difficult engineering problems. Researchers and<br>graduate
	students in any of these disciplines will find the material<br>intriguing,
	provocative, and revealing as will the curious and savvy<br>computing
	professional.<br><br>* Places particle swarms within the larger context
	of intelligent<br>adaptive behavior and evolutionary computation.
	<br>* Describes recent results of experiments with the particle swarm<br>optimization
	(PSO) algorithm <br>* Includes a basic overview of statistics to
	ensure readers can<br>properly analyze the results of their own experiments
	using the<br>algorithm. <br>* Support software which can be downloaded
	from the publishers<br>website, includes a Java PSO applet, C and
	Visual Basic source<br>code.}},

@article{deb02,
    abstract = {{Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) that use non-dominated sorting and sharing have been criticized mainly for: (1) their O(MN<sup>3</sup>) computational complexity (where M is the number of objectives and N is the population size); (2) their non-elitism approach; and (3) the need to specify a sharing parameter. In this paper, we suggest a non-dominated sorting-based MOEA, called NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II), which alleviates all of the above three difficulties. Specifically, a fast non-dominated sorting approach with O(MN<sup>2</sup>) computational complexity is presented. Also, a selection operator is presented that creates a mating pool by combining the parent and offspring populations and selecting the best N solutions (with respect to fitness and spread). Simulation results on difficult test problems show that NSGA-II is able, for most problems, to find a much better spread of solutions and better convergence near the true Pareto-optimal front 
compared to the Pareto-archived evolution strategy and the strength-Pareto evolutionary algorithm - two other elitist MOEAs that pay special attention to creating a diverse Pareto-optimal front. Moreover, we modify the definition of dominance in order to solve constrained multi-objective problems efficiently. Simulation results of the constrained NSGA-II on a number of test problems, including a five-objective, seven-constraint nonlinear problem, are compared with another constrained multi-objective optimizer, and the much better performance of NSGA-II is observed.}},

    abstract = {{Evolutionary computation techniques, genetic algorithms,
evolutionary strategies and genetic programming are motivated by the
evolution of nature. A population of individuals, which encode the
problem solutions are manipulated according to the rule of survival of
the fittest through  ” genetic” operations, such as mutation,
crossover and reproduction. A best solution is evolved through the
generations. In contrast to evolutionary computation techniques,
Eberhart and Kennedy developed a different algorithm through simulating
social behavior (R.C. Eberhart et al., 1996; R.C. Eberhart and J.
Kennedy, 1996; J. Kennedy and R.C. Eberhart, 1995; J. Kennedy, 1997). As
in other algorithms, a population of individuals exists. This algorithm
is called particle swarm optimization (PSO) since it resembles a school
of flying birds. In a particle swarm optimizer, instead of using genetic
operators, these individuals are  ” evolved” by cooperation
and competition among the individuals themselves through generations.
Each particle adjusts its flying according to its own flying experience
and its companions' flying experience. We introduce a new parameter,
called inertia weight, into the original particle swarm optimizer.
Simulations have been done to illustrate the significant and effective
impact of this new parameter on the particle swarm optimizer}},
