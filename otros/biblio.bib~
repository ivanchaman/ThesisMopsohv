	the hypervolume indicator of the quality of a set of $n$ non-dominated
	points in $d>2$ dimensions. It improves upon the existing HSO (Hypervolume
	by Slicing Objectives) algorithm by pruning the recursion tree to
	avoid repeated dominance checks and the recalculation of partial
	hypervolumes. Additionally, it incorporates a recent result for the
	three-dimensional special case. The proposed algorithm achieves $O(n^{d-2}
	\log n)$ time and linear space complexity in the worst-case, but
	experimental results show that the pruning techniques used may reduce
	the time complexity exponent even further.},

  abstract = {{<p>Traditional methods for creating intelligent computational systems
	have<br>privileged private "internal" cognitive and computational
	processes. In<br>contrast, <i>Swarm Intelligence</i> argues that
	human<br>intelligence derives from the interactions of individuals
	in a social world<br>and further, that this model of intelligence
	can be effectively applied to<br>artificially intelligent systems.
	The authors first present the foundations of<br>this new approach
	through an extensive review of the critical literature in<br>social
	psychology, cognitive science, and evolutionary computation. They<br>then
	show in detail how these theories and models apply to a new<br>computational
	intelligence methodologyparticle swarmswhich focuses<br>on adaptation
	as the key behavior of intelligent systems. Drilling down<br>still
	further, the authors describe the practical benefits of applying
	particle<br>swarm optimization to a range of engineering problems.
	Developed by<br>the authors, this algorithm is an extension of cellular
	automata and<br>provides a powerful optimization, learning, and problem
	solving method. <br><p><br>This important book presents valuable
	new insights by exploring the<br>boundaries shared by cognitive science,
	social psychology, artificial life,<br>artificial intelligence, and
	evolutionary computation and by applying these<br>insights to the
	solving of difficult engineering problems. Researchers and<br>graduate
	students in any of these disciplines will find the material<br>intriguing,
	provocative, and revealing as will the curious and savvy<br>computing
	professional.<br><br>* Places particle swarms within the larger context
	of intelligent<br>adaptive behavior and evolutionary computation.
	<br>* Describes recent results of experiments with the particle swarm<br>optimization

	ensure readers can<br>properly analyze the results of their own experiments
